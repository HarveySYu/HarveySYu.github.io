                            <p>I am Songlin Yu, but you can call me Harvey. I'm a senior-year Electrical Engineering student ar UCLA. 
                                I love playing around with circutis, and I sometimes build some small circuit project to entertain myself.
                                I believe convenience is primary productive force pushing the development of technology, and I want to build 
                                something that can make people live in a convenient way!

                        Technical experience-wise, I came up with the idea of the "hackathon" project, which is to drive a remote-controlled 
                        car with different control systems. The project was divided into three tiers: Control the car with the Bluetooth 
                        module and a Python Script, Drive the car with joystick module and IR remote control, and then ultimately make the car 
                        drive through mazes autonomously. Being the only Electrical Engineering major student in the mentor group, my 
                        responsibility of the project is to build up the prototype of the car and help to provide the part list and seeking 
                        for their venders. There were numerous challenges when I was building the circuit,
